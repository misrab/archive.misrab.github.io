# Things I Learnt Building a Team

_Posted on April 2nd, 2018_


## Introduction

At [Go-Jek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GO-JEK), I had the privilege of scaling
a data science team from a few members in one location, to about thirty people across
three countries.

This and past experiences have helped me come to certain preliminary conclusions on how teams best function,
in what I call my "general theory of organisations". This theory represents my own views (i.e. not necessarily
those of any company I've worked with). It's also most definitely a work in progress, and I'm more than happy to be
proven wrong on certain points, and refine these views. It's not meant to be a comprehensive theory, but hopefully contains
a couple nuggets of wisdom.

My favourite characterisations of organisations are "just a bunch of people working together to
create a product or service" [^1], or "information processing systems" [^2]. In other words, there are one
or multiple goals to achieve beyond what a single individual could output, so a group was formed. Simply put,
organisations are a solution to **the scaling problem**. So let's start by talking about how we can scale them optimally
to best address scaling of challenges.

## Scaling

I like to think of scaling as the following picture. Output is typically related to the product or service of the
organisation. It can be represented at different levels of granularity[^3], or relate to different objectives such as low
staff turnover or morale.

I would argue that most organisations encounter diminishing returns to scale, or the "bad" line. Incremental
team members contribute less and less marginal productivity as complexity and communication bottlenecks arise. In fact, even scaling output linearly with respect to team members is probably quite a feat. Hopefully, this feels anecdotally intuitive to you: ever felt the difference between having a 3rd member on a project, versus a 20th?

Imagine however an organisation that was able to achieve increasing returns to scale, labelled "excellent". This team would experience network effects as it grew (presumably within reasonable bounds?); if it were a company, it would leave the competition in the dirt. Think it's only a theoretical proposition? I disagree. I've seen and built teams where adding a novel skillset to a homogeneous group was like rocket fuel for productivity. And it gets better: one can presumably both shift (dashed line) these "excellent" levels of output upwards, and increase their slope, by improving **leverage** - tools and processes that enhance individual productivity, and team communication. More on this in a bit.
