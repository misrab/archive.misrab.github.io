# Jarvis

_Posted on March 25th, 2015_


## Introduction

When I say Jarvis ("Just A Rather Very Intelligent System"), I am of course referring to Iron Man's trusty [virtual assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Jarvis).
An AI personal assistant is not a novel idea. I've heard many a scientist and friend alike wish for one. Given the demand, the fact that there is no such comparable AI must be, of course, that it is difficult to create one.

That doesn't mean people haven't been trying for a while. Recent examples include Apple's [Siri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri), [Google Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Now), and Amazon's [Echo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo). Yet as amazing as these products are, they seem to fall short of what Jarvis is meant to be.

Apple, Google, and Amazon have the best technical talent out there. So what's stopping them from creating even a basic version of Jarvis? I'll start by trying to define features a reasonable Jarvis would possess. I'll do this before even exploring what's already out there in much detail myself - it will be interestig to see how they match up (I'm only superficially acquainted with what current virtual assistants can do). After showcasing existing products, I'll try to enumerate the simple, and advanced challenges before brainstorming possible paths forward.

## A Cool Jarvis

I envision multiple levels of Jarvis, and emphasise improvability in each component. If Jarvis can't improve a feature on the fly given feedback, it shouldn't be there. Also, I'm biased towards fundamental solutions instead of hardcoding, although there can be some hardcoding and manual tweaking initially (i.e. vs a strong AI from the start!).

### Basic Input Only

- Jarvis knows what words I'm saying (basic speech-to-text).
- I can correct a misunderstanding. This could even be a manual text edit, or a hardcoded verbal flow. The probabilistic impact should be meaningful.

### Input with context

- Jarvis remembers things I've said in the current conversation, possibly longer. This has meaningful probabilistic impact on his understanding of my words. Initially this can be super simple. Later it can include concepts and time.
- Hardcoded notion of an action, and meta action management.
