# Jarvis

_Posted on March 25th, 2015_


## Introduction

When I say Jarvis ("Just A Rather Very Intelligent System"), I am of course referring to Iron Man's trusty [virtual assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Jarvis).
An AI personal assistant is not a novel idea. I've heard many a scientist and friend alike wish for one. Given the demand, the fact that there is no such comparable AI must be, of course, that it is difficult to create one.

That doesn't mean people haven't been trying for a while. Recent examples include Apple's [Siri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri), [Google Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Now), and Amazon's [Echo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo). Yet as amazing as these products are, they seem to fall short of what Jarvis is meant to be.

Apple, Google, and Amazon have the best technical talent out there. So what's stopping them from creating even a basic version of Jarvis? I'll start by trying to define features a reasonable Jarvis would possess. I'll do this before even exploring what's already out there in much detail myself - it will be interestig to see how they match up (I'm only superficially acquainted with what current virtual assistants can do). After showcasing existing products, I'll try to enumerate the simple, and advanced challenges before brainstorming possible paths forward.


## Quick Digression on Augmented Intelligence

I'm frankly not a big fan of the whole "let's put chips in our brain" approach to augmented intelligence. Before even getting to that point, I think there's a lot more "natural" stuff to be done. Essentially anything that helps us reason about things over time. In fact, we've been doing it for a long time.

Writing can be seen as an extension of human intelligence. At its most basic level, it allows thoughts, or at least an approximation thereof, to be transfered across time. Intelligence is limited; I can only encompass so many ideas in my head at one time. So it's useful to extract the grain of a certain period's thinking and put it down on paper. Later in time, this can be used to trigger a summary of the process, or used as a component, an abstracted black box, in subsequent thinking, perhaps enabling higher level thoughts.


## A Cool Jarvis

I have an idea of what _I_ think would be a cool Jarvis. This is a bit subjective, so feel free to dream up your own alterations. Check out Iron Man's version of Jarvis [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwOxM0-byvc). He seems to be a fully sentient AI with the intelligence and deference of a human butler.


I envision multiple levels of Jarvis, and emphasise improvability in each component. If Jarvis can't improve a feature on the fly given feedback, it shouldn't be there. Also, I'm biased towards fundamental solutions instead of hardcoding, although there can be some hardcoding and manual tweaking initially (i.e. vs a strong AI from the start!).

### Basic Input Only

- Jarvis knows what words I'm saying (basic speech-to-text).
- I can correct a misunderstanding. This could even be a manual text edit, or a hardcoded verbal flow. The probabilistic impact should be meaningful.

### Input with context

- Jarvis remembers things I've said in the current conversation, possibly longer. This has meaningful probabilistic impact on his understanding of my words. Initially this can be super simple. Later it can include concepts and time.
- Hardcoded notion of an action, and meta action management.
