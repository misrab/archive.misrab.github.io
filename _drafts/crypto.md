What does one need to create a cryptocurrency? Firstly, I need to be able to own units of something, and secondly transfer them to others. So how do I prove that I have certain units of the currency? Typically you have a shared history of all transactions, and anyone can verify that the said units ended up most recently with you. That's part of the blockchain approach. Is there another way? Well even if the units emerge from an automated system, eventually they change hands. So you could track the changes, _or_ have the transaction itself mutate the unit. Then nobody has to go back to a history of transactions; ownership is embedded in the unit. On the blockchain, ownership is embedded in the transaction: payments are signed by the debitors private key, and verified with their public key. Here we'd instead have a system where the debitor can change the private key required to unlock a certain coin.
