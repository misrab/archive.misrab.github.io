# Stellar

_Posted on February 9th, 2015_


## Introduction

After spending some time thinking about cryptocurrencies, I have developed 
some opinions on where things are headed. I could be wrong, and these views will no doubt 
evolve over time, but I hope there is some reason in them. Cryptocurrency is fascinating, 
and definitely has a role to play in the future; the questions are what role and when.

I'll start by talking about Bitcoin and the Blockchain, and then move on to 
the Stellar payment infrastructure, which I currently find promising. I'll assume basic 
knowledge of how Bitcoin works. For a quick overview, see my [earlier post](/economics/2015-01-17-bitcoin.html) or related resources.

## Price Volatility

My first major concern is volatility. Take a look at the [CoinDesk](http://www.coindesk.com/price/) index of Bitcoin price in USD over the last year:

It's probably not news to you that Bitcoin's price has been somewhat volatile. It is after 
all a novel currency. Two questions arise: is volatility a problem, and will Bitcoin's price stabilise?

If we're hoping for a currency for trade of goods and services, and we assume the value of 
US dollars and other traditional currencies is relatively stable for the foreseable future (at least through the transition to digital currencies), volatility _is_ very much a problem. If I buy a can of soda today for the equivalent of $1 in Bitcoin, I will be upset tomorrow if it turns out I spent $100, or even USD $2 retrospectively.

On to the second question: will the price of Bitcoin, or another cryptocurrency with limited and predictable supply stabilise? To answer this, it's worth conducting a thought 
experiment in monetary theory.
