## High-Level Thoughts on Price Stability

### A World with only Bitcoin

Imagine a world where Bitcoin is **the only currency** for trading goods and services. Let's start by assuming everybody **owns** the same amount of Bitcoin. Further let's assume for now that everybody's **spending patterns** are the same: say 10% on cheese, 20% on fuel, 5% on haircuts, over some period of time.

What would the value of a Bitcoin be? Remember there is no other currency for comparison: no US dollars or Euros. To compare the value of Bitcoin relative to some product or service, we would simply take the average price over say a year. An average house price of 100 BTD (with given specifications) would mean that 1 BTD is worth 1/100 of such a house. If a carrot were on average 1 BTD, we'd then have a relative value between carrots and houses, through Bitcoin (as with any usual currency).

Prices will be negotiated on the market, and so will depend on all sorts of things beyond scarcity: bargaining power of buyers and sellers, prices before and after in the supply chain, human psychology. It is not enough to say prices of tomatoes will increases simply because fewer tomatoes were available in a given year.

Now consider that we're sufficiently far into the future that no more Bitcoin are being produced (in other words, it is deflationary). If there are no changes in the economy, prices don't change. However if, ceteris paribus, we increased overall output (as is likely the case with technical improvements), prices will decrease overall, meaning a Bitcoin is worth more over time.

Now human psychology comes into play. It becomes tempting to hold Bitcoin instead of spending. Much economic theory supposes this is dangerous to spending, but I don't think that is always the case. After, prices for things like electronics are always decreasing. People do wait before buying, but do eventually buy. **Here's the important part**: the rate of price decrease (or output increase, or change in other factors with equivalent result) is offset by human patience, which we can call the "discount factor". As long as prices are not decreasing at a rate beyond this, consumption will be fine. Holders of currency accumulate rent, but want to spend eventually, transferring the asset to others. As with any rent generating asset, at times there is a transfer of wealth: people who own multiple houses gain in relative wealth when house prices shoot up. This is not a problem with deflationary currency, it is a problem with unequal ownership of assets and fluctuation in prices, _due_ to factors including but not limited to scarcity.


### The Current Bitcoin World

Currently, Bitcoin is not the only currency in circulation. In fact, one could argue that it isn't much of a currency at all: most merchants still don't accept it. The vast majority of Bitcoin trading is speculation.

On a positive note, more and more merchants are accepting it, including Microsoft, Dell, Newegg, Monoprix and [others](http://www.coindesk.com/information/what-can-you-buy-with-bitcoins/). Exchanges like [Coinbase](http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/20/coinbase-confirms-75m-raise-from-dfj-nyse-strategic-banking-partners/) are racking in investments, and report increasing non-trading transaction volume, currently standing at a significant 12%.

But is Bitcoin really a viable currency to buy and sell products? Given its fixed supply, novelty and speculation, it still experiences heavy girations in price (in USD below, [CoinDesk BPI](http://www.coindesk.com/price/)):

The creates a problem for transacting. If I buy a coke can today for what seems like a reasonable price in Bitcoin, I don't want to find out tomorrow that it cost me US$100 retrospectively. The touted benefits of decentralisation and low transaction costs suddenly ring very, very faintly.

That said, the facts seem to support that some people are willing to buy and sell in the currency, at least for now. Perhaps volatility is decreasing, and although high, is at an acceptable order of magnitude (fluctuations less than 100%, as opposed to thousands or more). Perhaps there are niches where Bitcoin is sufficiently advantages, like the dark net, black markets, or more legit areas like currency exchange and bank-to-bank transaction. More interestingly, it could be that Bitcoin is acting as a very short term intermediate, thereby obviating more of the volatility risk.


### Stable Volatility

A big question is whether Bitcoin's value relative to other currencies and products will stabilise. One approach is to think of where the currency is headed, hence the scenario of a "Bitcoin-only world" described earlier. _If_ in fact Bitcoin is on its way to being fully accepted for any transaction in the world, it will experience massive appreciation. Essentially take the value of global GDP and divide it by different currencies in circulation, weighted against their [monetary velocity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_money). I think this could provide a _crude_ value of a currency's unit value, although I'm open to feedback and definitely want to check that against data.

One of the assumptions here is that Bitcoin has access to the global economy. If in fact it turns into a niche currency for say tomatoes, we'll want to look at that market alone.

Returning to the question of volatility, say we know what a Bitcoin's price _should_ be, and we expect it to converge to that (or go bust).
