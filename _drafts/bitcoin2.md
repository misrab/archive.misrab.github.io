## High-Level Thoughts on Price Stability

Imagine a world where Bitcoin is **the only currency** for trading goods and services. Let's start by assuming everybody **owns** the same amount of Bitcoin. Further let's assume for now that everybody's **spending patterns** are the same: say 10% on cheese, 20% on fuel, 5% on haircuts, over some period of time.

What would the value of a Bitcoin be? Remember there is no other currency for comparison: no US dollars or Euros. To compare the value of Bitcoin relative to some product or service, we would simply take the average price over say a year. An average house price of 100 BTD (with given specifications) would mean that 1 BTD is worth 1/100 of such a house. If a carrot were on average 1 BTD, we'd then have a relative value between carrots and houses, through Bitcoin (as with any usual currency).

Prices will be negotiated on the market, and so will depend on all sorts of things beyond scarcity: bargaining power of buyers and sellers, prices before and after in the supply chain, human psychology. It is not enough to say prices of tomatoes will increases simply because fewer tomatoes were available in a given year.

Now consider that we're sufficiently far into the future that no more Bitcoin are being produced (in other words, it is deflationary). If there are no changes in the economy, prices don't change. However if, ceteris paribus, we increased overall output (as is likely the case with technical improvements), prices will decrease overall, meaning a Bitcoin is worth more over time.

Now human psychology comes into play. It becomes tempting to hold Bitcoin instead of spending. Much economic theory supposes this is dangerous to spending, but I don't think that is always the case. After, prices for things like electronics are always decreasing. People do wait before buying, but do eventually buy. **Here's the important part**: the rate of price decrease (or output increase, or change in other factors with equivalent result) is offset by human patience, which we can call the "discount factor". As long as prices are not decreasing at a rate beyond this, consumption will be fine. Holders of currency accumulate rent, but want to spend eventually, transferring the asset to others. As with any rent generating asset, at times there is a transfer of wealth: people who own multiple houses gain in relative wealth when house prices shoot up. This is not a problem with deflationary currency, it is a problem with unequal ownership of assets and fluctuation in prices, _due_ to factors including but not limited to scarcity.
