# Quotient Groups

_Posted on February 26th, 2015_

## Introduction

## Kernels, Images and Centers

## Cosets

// - mention superimportant. mention left, right
// - partitions and counting!
// - prime order groups

## Cosets & Cyclic Groups

// - nZ is cyclic. (re)show that nZ defines all cyclic groups 
// of order n.
// - show that aZ's form _all_ cosets of Z through Euclidean alg
//   i.e. so we know we're not missing any parts of Z


## Modular Arithmetic

// - relate to cosets for intuition. draw attention to + vs \circ etc..
