# Quotient Groups

_Posted on February 26th, 2015_

## Introduction





Let's recap what we've been doing so far. We have these things called "groups", with 
an associative operation \circ defined between elements, identities and 
inverses. Addition on real numbers is a group. Division on integers is not, since $1/2 \notin \mathbf{Z}$.

We then looks at maps between groups written $ f: G \rightarrow G' $. **Homomorphism**, 
where $f(a) \cdot f(b) = f(a) \cdot f(b)$ seemed interesting in the way they preserve some 
sort of structure between groups. Isomorphisms present seemingly disparate groups as one.

Let's see if we can break these maps into more detail.

## Kernels, Images and Centers

The collection of elements 'reached' in $G'$ by applying $f$ to elements in $G$ is called the image of f:

![image of map]()

The elements in $G$ that get mapped to the identity in $G'$ are the kernel of $f$. I like ot think of these as items in $G$ that get 'smashed' down to $e'#:

![kernel]()

Finally, the center of a _group_ are those elements that commute with other elements in the group.

# Normal Subgroups



# Kernel of a Homomorphism

Consider the kernel of a homomorphism $ \phi: G \rightarrow G' $. In other words, consider 
$ \phi(G) = \\{ g \in G : \phi(g) = e' \\} $.


## Equivalence & Cosets

// - mention superimportant. mention left, right
// - partitions and counting!
// - prime order groups

## Cosets & Cyclic Groups

// - nZ is cyclic. (re)show that nZ defines all cyclic groups 
// of order n.
// - show that aZ's form _all_ cosets of Z through Euclidean alg
//   i.e. so we know we're not missing any parts of Z


## Modular Arithmetic

// - relate to cosets for intuition. draw attention to + vs \circ etc..
