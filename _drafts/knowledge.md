# Knowledge & Discovery


_Posted on October 28th, 2015_


More than once, I've heard someone say something along the lines of "the age of discovery is dead". The prose is not always so extreme, but the core idea is the same: the more the human race knows, the less there is to discover.

I knew that I disagreed with this the first time I heard it, but after some reflection the reasons are a bit more clear to me. I thought the conclusions were sufficiently interesting to share, in that they relate to the general concepts of knowledge and discovery.

First of all, in many ways there probably is less and less low hanging fruit to discover.
