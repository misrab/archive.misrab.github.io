# Understanding Complexity


## Introduction

I think we all have an intuitive notion of complexity. We encounter it in the things we learn, the projects we work on alone or in teams, and even in our physical surroundings. I've found that simplicity and organisation can be the defining factor for progress. Complexity can be a laborious swamp that inhibits great things happening.

Complexity is ubiquitous in the truest sense. Hence understanding at least part of the dynamics at play seems very worthwhile to me. At the very least the impact on one's own effectiveness could be great; on the other hand, it could transform large organisations and the world we live in.

Perhaps we'll only scratch the surface here, but I do hope to develop an understanding of complexity that yields tangible results, even if only on an individual level (but hopefully much more). This post was inspired by my experience at work, as well as the problems I've faced when working on my own side-projects.


This can sometimes be 
subjective: a seemingly messy desk could be organised to one person but not to another. 
This suggests something more fundamental than 

## Brainstorm

Before trying to be too technical or precise, I thought it would be helpful to just brainstorm some ideas I find related to the notion of "complexity". I've tried to group them in ways I find meaningful. You may or may not agree! Try and think of other ways of looking at complexity, and keep them in mind and you read the rest of the post. I'll try and tie the ones that I've idenitified in.
