# Asset Prices


_Posted on January 21th, 2016_


There has been lots of emphasis in the news of late on slumping global oil prices, slowing growth in China, and related declines in stock markets. These have all largely been portrayed as negative events, and I wanted to spend some time thinking about whether that's really the case. Namely, are asset price decreases a bad thing?

It's a complex issue, and there are many lenses: sociological, material, etc. My intention is not to explore them all, but rather gain an intuition for the general dynamics. Pardon the simplifications.

So what happens when stock prices decrease? All the red screens and downward sloping graphs indeed make it seem ominous. But fundamentally, I see there being two components:

1. all goods and services produced
2. the relative claim individuals have over these

In other words, prices are just the relative exchange value of different products; wealth is just the relative purchasing power of people.
