# Abstract Groups

_Posted on November 11th, 2014_


## Introduction

Groups, and what follows from them, are really cool. Had I known earlier, I 
would have seriously started studying group theory a long time ago.

What makes abstract algebra in general so interesting, to me at least? I think it is 
that it sits at a great tradeoff point between generality and structure. The foundation 
is very simple (and thus general), yet it leads to extremely interesting ways of thinking.

'Nuff said, let's dive in.

## On Generalisation

## Groups

## Cyclic Groups

## Subgroups

## Maps

## Morphisms

## Kernel, Image and Center

## Quotient Groups

Now is when things start to get really exciting.

## Conclusion

## Ackowledgements

A huge thanks to anyone contributing to open-source in general, 'tis the best 
way forward. In this specific case, thanks to Harvard's online 
[Abstract Algebra course](http://www.extension.harvard.edu/open-learning-initiative/abstract-algebra).
