## What tools could I build to make myself more productive

What is productive. Minimising the barriers to getting stuff done. Reducing the ratio of busy work to real work. That's what I mean by productive here.

Does this depend on the type of work? I guess it can. Being more productive at moving water around might mean carrying tubes around. So let's focus on two types: the most generic tools, and the tools specific to the things I'd like to do.

First of all, what things would I like to do. 




## Academics

- relationship to academic education. Upside is density, but also 
comment on downsides i.e. express thoughts on why I don't want to 
go to school right now.
	- can focus (loan/other funding aside)
	- high density byproduct of focus
