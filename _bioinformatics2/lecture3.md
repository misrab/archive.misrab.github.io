_Notes from Imperial's Bioinformatics Course_

## Lecture 3 - Prediction of Protein Structure

### Experimental methods

- **X-Ray Crystallography**: requires crystals of proteins, very difficult
- **NMR**: limited to ~<300 amino acids
- **Cryo-Electron Microscopy**: low resolution ~3-15A

CASP ("critical" assessment of struct prediction): blind test on available 
methods every 2 years.

### Other methods

- Ab-initio energy calculations: suceptible to local minima, computationally expensive
- Secondary structure i.e. Q3: look for three types of structures like $$ \alpha, \beta $$, coil
- Chou-Fasman method with defined rules
