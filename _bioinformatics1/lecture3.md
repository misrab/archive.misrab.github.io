## Lecture 3 - DNA Sequence Analysis

### Cutting DNA: Restriction Nucleases

- Where art thou, exons? **Hybridise** with mRNA, cut out single strands,

- Cloning genes with bacterial plasmids using restriction nucleases

### Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

Amplify small amounts of DNA exponentially (we use d*TP since we're making **D**NA).

1. Application: identifying sequence variation

2. Application: using bacteria to make protein (**expression vectors**)

### Sanger Sequencing (old school)

Use di-deoxy..., read (i.e. gel chromatography), undo, repeat.

### Illumina Technology

Get many small reads, then combine programatically.
