## Lecture 2 - Genes & Proteins

### The Central Dogma

Exceptions arguably include [prions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion) 
and [retroviruses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrovirus).

Some pedantic/questionable definitions:

- **genotype**: the complete set of genetic variants at all loci in the genome
- **phenotype**: the overall behaviour of an organism which impacts its 
reproductive success

### DNA Packaging: Histones & Chromatin

[Chromosomes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome) are amazing: they have multiple layers of organisation:

**Careful**: in the first image below we have manually paired
homologous chromosomes. In the second, we have a 
replicated and condensed metaphase _single_ chromosome. It just so happens that
we inherit chromosomes in pairs.

### Some DNA Replication Terminology

- Parental DNA
- Leading/lagging strands
- Primase, RNA primer, DNA polymerase
- DNA ligase, Okazaki fragments
- Helicase to unwind

### Synthesis Directionality

DNA is synthesized **5' --> 3'** of the new strand because of **proof-reading**.
Enery provided by incoming nucleotide.

**If** we went 3' --> 5', works fine until we proof-read: then the strand has no 
high-energy bond to break (at least not in the connection: yes the incoming nucleotide
has one, but would require extra machinery I guess).

### Misc

- Transcription factors, enhancers, repressors
- Chromatin remodelling complex
- Regulation steps in the central dogma
- Recombination
